## 🚀 Project Report: Clinic Management System – Direction

### 🔷 Project Title:

**Clinic Management System – Direction**

### 🔷 Domain:

**Healthcare**

### 🔷 Technology Stack:

* Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Backend & Database: Firebase Authentication, Firestore Database, Firebase Hosting

---

### 🔷 Objective:

To streamline communication between doctors and receptionists in a clinical setting by automating patient token generation, record management, prescription flow, and billing.

---

### 🔷 System Features:

#### 1. **Doctor Login:**

* Doctors authenticate via Firebase.
* View assigned patients and their medical history.
* Add/update prescriptions which are shared to the receptionist.

#### 2. **Receptionist Login:**

* Login with secure Firebase Authentication.
* Register new patients and generate a unique token.
* Initiate billing based on the doctor’s prescription.

#### 3. **Token Generation:**

* Auto-incremented and stored in Firebase.
* Time-stamped for accurate queue management.

#### 4. **Patient Record Management:**

* Add patient name, age, gender, symptoms.
* Attach doctor notes and prescriptions.
* Records are stored and viewable historically.

#### 5. **Prescription Flow:**

* After doctor entry, prescriptions are synced to receptionist UI.
* Enables quick billing and discharge process.

#### 6. **Billing Advice:**

* Simple JSON-based itemized bill generated per patient.
* Total amount computed and displayed instantly.

---

### 🧩 System Design & Architecture:

#### 🔸 Frontend:

* Responsive UI using HTML5, CSS3.
* DOM manipulation and Firebase interactions via JavaScript.

#### 🔸 Backend (Firebase Services Used):

* **Authentication:** For Doctor/Receptionist role-based login.
* **Firestore:** Stores patient info, tokens, prescriptions, billing.
* **Hosting (optional):** Deploy for public or internal use.

#### 🔸 Architecture Diagram:

---

### 🔧 Code & Database Quality:

* Modular JavaScript structure.
* Configs separated in `firebase-config.js`.
* CRUD operations abstracted in respective modules (`patient.js`, `billing.js`).
* Code is **safe**, **portable**, **testable**, and **maintainable**.

### 📈 Evaluation Metrics:

| Metric              | Description                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Modularity**      | Divided into login, tokens, patient, billing modules |
| **Safety**          | Secure authentication and data validation            |
| **Portability**     | Runs in browser; Firebase abstracts backend infra    |
| **Testability**     | Functions are unit-testable independently            |
| **Maintainability** | Easy to add modules (e.g., lab reports)              |

---

### 🔐 Logging:

* System logs errors to console and alert popups for users.
* Important actions are stored with timestamps in Firestore.

---

### 🌐 Deployment:

* Deployed on Firebase Hosting.
* Public access link (to be filled after deploy):
  `https://<project-id>.web.app/`

---

### 📌 Optimization Considerations:

* Lazy loading for data-heavy views.
* Role-based UI rendering.
* Optimized Firestore reads with indexed queries.
